# ML Projects

## Why Machine Learning?
I'd start with Machine Learning as it has both extensive and relatively cleanly coded and well documented projects. I can use Github for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.
