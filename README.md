# ML Projects

## Introduction

Welcome to my ML projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small projects that demonstrate various machine learning techniques and concepts. Each project is designed to showcase different algorithms, datasets, or applications within the field of machine learning.


## Why Machine Learning?
I chose to delve into machine learning because of its incredible potential to extract meaningful insights from data and make predictions or decisions based on patterns and statistical probabilities. The ability to teach machines to learn from data and improve over time is not only fascinating but also holds immense practical value across numerous industries.
