# NN VISION

## Description
**NN VISION** is a web application that allows users to visualize the structure of neural networks. It provides a user-friendly interface to interactively explore different network architectures, layer configurations, and activation functions. With this tool, users can gain a deeper understanding of how neural networks operate and how changes in architecture can affect their performance.

## Features
- **Visualize Neural Networks**: Display the structure of a neural network with customizable layers.
- **Interactive Configuration**: Show the number of neurons in each layer and the activation function used.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for selecting architectures, inputting values, and viewing results.
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Calculate hidden and output node values instantly.
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless viewing on different devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aksshatgovind/ML-Projects/tree/main/NN%20VISION.git
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
